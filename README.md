# Screen Control Definition Format (scdf)
A format that allows for a standard way to describe a user interface for efficient AI screen control. It can describe any app regardless of platform (Windows, Linux, Web, etc).

It can describe:

- Location of buttons
- Functionality of a certain window
- Links/connections between different windows

And it's not just read-only. An AI screen control app could also update the SCDF (either locally or on a hosted database) if it encounters a new UI with primative information.
